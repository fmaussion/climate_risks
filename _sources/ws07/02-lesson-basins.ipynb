    "\n",
    "- **RGIId**: The unique identifier for each glacier in the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI).  \n",
    "- **BgnDate**: The date of the satellite image used to delineate the glacier, in YYYYMMDD format.  \n",
    "- **CenLon, CenLat**: The central longitude and latitude of the glacier, representing its approximate centroid.  \n",
    "- **O1Region, O2Region**: The primary and secondary region codes according to the RGI classification. These help categorize glaciers by geographic location.  \n",
    "- **Area**: The glacier’s total surface area in square kilometers (km²).  \n",
    "- **Zmin, Zmax, Zmed**: The minimum, maximum, and median elevation of the glacier in meters above sea level (m a.s.l.).  \n",
    "- **Slope**: The average surface slope of the glacier, measured in degrees.  \n",
    "- **Aspect**: The dominant aspect (orientation) of the glacier, measured in degrees (0° = North, 90° = East, 180° = South, 270° = West).  \n",
    "- **Name**: The given name of the glacier, if available. Many glaciers remain unnamed and are recorded as `NaN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides a static snapshot of glaciers at the time of their delineation, meaning it does not track their changes over time. The RGI's primary goal is to provide glacier **outlines** - here I scrapped them out of the file and only provide some statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few questions to get you started:\n",
    "- how many glaciers are there in the RGI?\n",
    "- what is their total area?\n",
    "- what is the maximum glacier elevation?\n",
    "- can you plot a histogram of the `Aspect` of the glaciers? What is the dominant direction of glaciers? Was it predictable?\n",
    "- optional: select all glaciers in the northern hemisphere, and repeat the histogram\n",
    "- optional: now group the glaciers per `O1Region` (hint: `groupby()`), and compute the total area per RGI region"
