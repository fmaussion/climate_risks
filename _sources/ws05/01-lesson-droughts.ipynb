    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve looked at the **monthly water balance** (`P − PET`) — the difference between water supply and loss by evaporation. This gives us a first impression of when and where water deficits (droughts) or surpluses (wet periods) occur.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the raw water balance has some limitations:\n",
    "- Its **mean and variance depend on the local climate** — a value of −50 mm/month may mean something very different in Spain than in Scotland.  \n",
    "- It’s not easy to compare **anomalies** across regions or between seasons.  \n",
    "- We don’t have a clear threshold for when conditions become “dry enough” to be considered a drought.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these issues, scientists developed the **Standardised Precipitation–Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, [Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1175/2009JCLI2909.1))**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What SPEI does\n",
    "\n",
    "SPEI transforms the raw water balance into a dimensionless index that tells us *how unusual* a given month’s conditions are compared to the long-term record at that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this in three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accumulate the water balance** over a given time window (e.g. 1, 3, 6, or 12 months).  \n",
    "   - Short timescales capture short, intense dry spells.  \n",
    "   - Long timescales capture multi-season or hydrological droughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fit a probability distribution** to the long-term series of accumulated water balance values  \n",
    "   (typically a *log-logistic* or *Pearson type III* distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standardise** the values (transform them into *z-scores*), so that:\n",
    "   - 0 → average conditions  \n",
    "   - −1 → moderate drought (about the 15th percentile)  \n",
    "   - −2 → severe drought  \n",
    "   - +1 → unusually wet period\n",
    "   - etc\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is comparable across regions and climates — an SPEI = −2 means an equally rare dry event anywhere on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "SPEI is now one of the most widely used indices for analysing and monitoring climatic droughts,  \n",
    "because it captures both precipitation deficits and the increasing evaporative demand due to warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing SPEI in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use the open-source [`spei`](https://martinvonk.github.io/SPEI/) Python package, which implements the methods described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simply feed our water balance time series into the function and compute SPEI for different accumulation timescales (e.g. 3, 12, 24 months) — just as it is done in published drought datasets such as [SPEIbase](https://spei.csic.es/).\n",
