# IPCC AR6 WG2 – Part 1

## Before the workshop

1. Access the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) from the IPCC AR6 WG2 report [here](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/).
2. Skim through the SPM up until *Section C: Adaptation Measures and Enabling Conditions* (excluded), and identify the key messages and figures.

## Introduction

*(15 minutes)*

Fabien will briefly explain the role of the IPCC, Working Group 2 (Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability), and Working Group 1 (Physical Science Basis). We’ll then form thematic groups and introduce the breakout group activity.

```{admonition} Note on key terms
:class: note

In this workshop, we use the concept of **climate risk**, defined as arising from the interaction between:

- **Hazards**: climate-related events or trends  
- **Exposure**: what is in harm’s way  
- **Vulnerability**: how susceptible that exposed system is to harm  

We’ll use the term **impact** to refer to the *realized or expected effects*, i.e. the actual or projected harm that results from that interaction.
```

## Breakout groups

For the first two workshops on IPCC WG2, you will be split into three groups. Each group will be assigned a broader theme (see below) and will discuss it in more depth. The goal is to identify the key **impacts** within your theme and to choose **one specific impact** to work on in more detail for the next workshop.

The timings below are indicative and can be adjusted as needed.

### (Quiet) reading time

*(~30 minutes)*

Each group reads the relevant parts of the SPM — **this now includes Section C and beyond** — and identifies as many impacts as possible related to their theme. Each member should list these impacts individually and take personal notes.

Consider the **time horizon**:
- Are these impacts already occurring?
- If not, when are they expected to occur?
- How confident is the scientific community about them?

If you have time, explore one of the [interactive atlases](#interactive-atlases) to find more regional or sector-specific impacts. We recommend starting with the [PROVIDE Climate Risk Dashboard](https://climate-risk-dashboard.iiasa.ac.at).

### Group discussion

*(~20 minutes)*

As a group, aim to create a comprehensive list of impacts within your theme. For each impact, discuss:
- What is the **hazard** driving it?
- What creates **exposure** to this hazard?
- Who or what is **vulnerable**, and under what conditions?

This is meant to be a wide-ranging, exploratory discussion. Try to cover a range of examples, but don’t worry about getting all the details yet — the aim is to choose **one impact** to focus on next.

## Preparation for next week

*(~20 minutes)*

As a group, prepare a short presentation for next week’s workshop. It should analyse your chosen impact using all **three components of risk**: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

At this stage, you should:

- **Choose one specific impact** to focus on.
  - Narrow enough to be manageable
  - Broad enough to find literature and data
  - Potentially linked to an [interactive atlas](#interactive-atlases), though this is not required
- **Assign roles** within the group:
  - Two students focus on **hazard**
  - Two on **exposure**
  - Two on **vulnerability**

Each pair gathers information on their component:
- Can you find **real-world examples** of the impact in the literature?
- What are the **key drivers** of the hazard?
- What conditions create exposure?
- What systems or populations are vulnerable — and why?

- **Identify a possible case study**:
  - Choose a specific region or country where this impact is occurring or projected to occur.
  - Consider recent events, long-term projections, or highly exposed regions.

- **Start gathering background information**:
  Use the SPM, the full report, and any other credible sources you find relevant.

## Plenary sharing

*(15 minutes – 5 minutes per group)*

Each group shares:
- A summary of the impacts they identified
- The specific impact chosen for next week’s deeper analysis

## Themes

1. **Ecosystems and biodiversity** *(natural systems)*  
   Climate impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, including non-human species and ecological processes.  
   *Example impacts*: coral reef bleaching due to ocean warming, species shifting their ranges (e.g. alpine plants moving upslope), increased wildfire risk in forests.

2. **Human systems (health, food, and water)** *(societal systems)*  
   Climate impacts on human well-being and livelihoods, including agriculture, food security, water resources, and health — in both rural and urban contexts.  
   *Example impacts*: reduced crop yields from drought, increased malnutrition, water scarcity in snowmelt-dependent regions, spread of climate-sensitive diseases.

3. **Urban and infrastructure systems** *(built systems)*  
   Climate impacts on cities and infrastructure (transport, energy, housing), with a focus on adaptation and resilience.  
   *Example impacts*: urban flooding from sea-level rise and heavy rain, energy system failures during heatwaves, damage to transport networks.

```{note}
Like everything else in our climate system, the three themes are interlinked!
