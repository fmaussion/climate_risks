**Learning python:**

Here are my favorites resources for Python beginers in STEM:

- There is an excellent Python tutorial provided by the [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation). It's based on a real data analysis and I strongly recommend it.
- Chapter 1 from the [Scientific Python lectures](https://lectures.scientific-python.org) is also excellent.
- Finally, my own classes provide some resources as well, but they are more adapted to a classroom than self-study: [beginner](http://fabienmaussion.info/intro_to_programming), [advanced](http://fabienmaussion.info/scientific_programming).

**Learning climate analysis with python:**

The excellent resources by Climatematch inspired some of my notes:
- [comptools.climatematch.io](https://comptools.climatematch.io)

[Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/) contains fantastic resources:
- [Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org)
- [CookBooks](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org)

**Interactive climate dashboards:**

- [PROVIDE Climate Risk Dashboard](https://climate-risk-dashboard.iiasa.ac.at)
- [Met Office Climate Data Portal](https://climatedataportal.metoffice.gov.uk/) (see local authority risk assessment)
- [IPCC Interactive Atlas](https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch)
- [Climate Impact Explorer](https://climate-impact-explorer.climateanalytics.org)

**Further lecture notes by Fabien:**
- [💻 Introduction to Python Programming](http://fabienmaussion.info/intro_to_programming) (undergraduate level)
- [🧑‍💻 Scientific Programming in Python](https://fabienmaussion.info/scientific_programming) (postgraduate level)
- [🌍 Physics of the Climate System Practicals](https://fabienmaussion.info/climate_system)

**Miscellanea**
- The excellent episode of "Cautionary Tales" about how risk mitigation measures can go wrong: [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0gy6fs6), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVv_y7vkQAw)
