    "In this assignment, you will explore how glaciers are projected to evolve over the 21st century under different climate scenarios. Using real model output from CMIP6-based glacier projections, your task is to load, analyze, and visualize ensemble data to assess both the magnitude and climate forcing uncertainty of future glacier change.\n",
